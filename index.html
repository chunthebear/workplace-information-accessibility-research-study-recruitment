</head>
<body>
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Hello! Researchers at the University of Victoria, Department of Computer Science, together with CNIB Research, are conducting research to understand and design technology that facilitates effective communication of shared data and information in professional collaborative settings where team members have mixed visual abilities.</p>

<h1>Eligibility Criteria</h1>
<p>If you meet the following criteria, we would love to hear and learn from you!
<ul>
    <li>Being an adult (19 years or older)</li>
    <li>Being a professional information worker who engages in collaborative activities</li>
    <li>Working in a team where at least one colleague is blind or has low vision (including you)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h1> Study Details</h1>
<p>The study involves a diary study where you will document your experiences and challenges with shared information at work, and a post-diary interview to explore factors affecting information representation and team workflows. Both take place remotely.</p>

<h1>Study Duration and Compensation</h1>
<p>The study will last five working days during working hours. Your work supervisor will be informed about this. As a thank you for your time, we will provide an Amazon gift card or e-transfer of $50 CAD.</p>

<h1>Why Participate?</h1>
<p>Through this study, you will gain awareness of your work practices and help tackle inclusivity and accessibility issues in diverse visual ability settings. Your insights will be crucial in designing better, inclusive technology for collaborative work, enhancing life quality and productivity for people with mixed visual abilities. The study will deepen our understanding of shared information use in professional collaboration and how visual abilities influence these processes.</p>
